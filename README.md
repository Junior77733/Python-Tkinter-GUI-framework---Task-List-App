# Python-Tkinter-GUI-framework---Task-List-App
A Task List app created using one of Python's GUI frameworks, tkinter.

Allows for creating tasks and setting timers.
Sends notifications to your desktop when the timer activates, notifying you of your task.

**Things to improve on**:

1 - Notifications only activate on a windows OS as of now, will improve upon this soon.
<br>
2 - Several Menu tabs provide no functionality as of now (with the exception of exit which closes the App)
    these Tabs were created as a showcase rather than for general use but the 'exit' tab was given one to
    show that functionality can be easily applied in a real scenario (Not just for a showcase).
